# ðŸ—‘ Removing Bricks

## ðŸš€ Overview

Installed bricks can be uninstalled via the `remove` command.

## ðŸ—‚ Local

We can uninstall a brick in a local workspace by running `mason remove` followed by the brick name:

```bash
mason remove example
âœ“ Removed example (22ms)
```

The above command will uninstall the `example` brick in the current workspace.

## ðŸŒŽ Global

We can uninstall a global brick by adding the `--global` (`-g` for short) flag:

```bash
mason remove -g widget
âœ“ Removed widget (21ms)
```
