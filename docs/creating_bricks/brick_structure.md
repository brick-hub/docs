# ğŸ§± Structure of a Brick

## ğŸš€ Overview

If we take a closer look at the example brick we just generated, it should look like:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ __brick__
â””â”€â”€ brick.yaml
```

The `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`, and `README` are all standard files found across many projects so we won't focus on them. The two important entities are the `__brick__` directory and the `brick.yaml` file.

## `brick.yaml`

The `brick.yaml` file is a manifest which contains metadata for the current brick. The newly generated `brick.yaml` should look something like:

```yaml
name: example
description: An example brick

# The following defines the version and build number for your brick.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.34
# followed by an optional build number (separated by a +).
version: 0.1.0+1

# The following defines the environment for the current brick.
# It includes the version of mason that the brick requires.
environment:
  mason: '>=0.1.0-dev <0.1.0'

# Variables specify dynamic values that your brick depends on.
# Zero or more variables can be specified for a given brick.
# Each variable has:
#  * a type (string, number, boolean, enum, or array)
#  * an optional short description
#  * an optional default value
#  * an optional list of default values (array only)
#  * an optional prompt phrase used when asking for the variable
#  * a list of values (enums only)
vars:
  name:
    type: string
    description: Your name.
    default: Dash
    prompt: What is your name?
```

## `__brick__`

The `__brick__` directory contains the template for your brick. Any files, directories within the `__brick__` will be generated when the brick is used via `mason make`.

In the example brick, our `__brick__` directory contains a single file called `HELLO.md` with the following content:

```md
# Hello {{name}}!
```

:::note
Templates currently support [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) but support for additional templating specifications is on the roadmap.
