# Creating Bricks ‚ú®

In this section, we'll take a look at how to use the `mason new` command to create your own bricks.

## Overview üöÄ

The `mason new` command allows us to create a new, custom brick template in the current working directory:

```bash
$ mason new example
‚úì Created new brick: example (74ms)
‚úì Generated 5 file(s):
  /me/mason_playground/example/brick.yaml (new)
  /me/mason_playground/example/README.md (new)
  /me/mason_playground/example/CHANGELOG.md (new)
  /me/mason_playground/example/LICENSE (new)
  /me/mason_playground/example/__brick__/HELLO.md (new)
```

## Anatomy of a Brick üß±

If we take a closer look at the example brick we just generated, it should look like:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __brick__
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ brick.yaml
```

The `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`, and `README` are all standard files found across many projects so we won't focus on them. The two important entities are the `__brick__` directory and the `brick.yaml` file.

### `brick.yaml`

The `brick.yaml` file is a manifest which contains metadata for the current brick. The newly generated `brick.yaml` should look something like:

```yaml
name: example
description: An example brick

# The following defines the version and build number for your brick.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.34
# followed by an optional build number (separated by a +).
version: 0.1.0+1

# The following defines the environment for the current brick.
# It includes the version of mason that the brick requires.
environment:
  mason: '>=0.1.0-dev <0.1.0'

# Variables specify dynamic values that your brick depends on.
# Zero or more variables can be specified for a given brick.
# Each variable has:
#  * a type (string, number, boolean, enum, or array)
#  * an optional short description
#  * an optional default value
#  * an optional list of default values (array only)
#  * an optional prompt phrase used when asking for the variable
#  * a list of values (enums only)
vars:
  name:
    type: string
    description: Your name.
    default: Dash
    prompt: What is your name?
```

### `__brick__`

The `__brick__` directory contains the template for your brick. Any files, directories within the `__brick__` will be generated when the brick is used via `mason make`.

In the example brick, our `__brick__` directory contains a single file called `HELLO.md` with the following content:

```md
# Hello {{name}}!
```

:::note
Templates currently support [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) but support for additional templating specifications is on the roadmap.
:::

:::tip
Refer to the [mustache specification](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) for more information about `mustache` and its capabilities.
:::

## Custom Description ‚úçÔ∏è

We can use the `--desc` option to specify a custom brick description when creating a new brick via `mason new`:

```bash
$ mason new example --desc "My awesome brick"
```

## Custom Output Directory üóÇ

Similarly to `mason make`, we can specify a custom output directory when creating a new brick via the `-o` option:

```bash
$ mason new example -o ./path/to/brick
```

## Hooks ü™ù

`Mason` supports custom script execution via hooks.

The supported hooks are:

- `pre_gen` - executed immediately before the generation step
- `post_gen` - executed immediately after the generation step

Hooks must be defined in the hooks directory at the root of the brick:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __brick__
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ brick.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ post_gen.dart
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pre_gen.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.yaml
```

The easiest way to get started with hooks is by specifying the `--hooks` flag when creating a new brick:

```bash
$ mason new example --hooks
```

:::note
Currently `mason` only supports hooks written in Dart.
:::

### Hooks Usage ‚ú®

Every hook must contain a `run` method which accepts a `HookContext` from `package:mason/mason.dart`.

Hooks can be used to manipulate variables, interface with the logger, and more:

**`pre_gen.dart`**

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:mason/mason.dart';

void run(HookContext context) {
  // Read vars.
  final name = context.vars['name'];

  // Use the `Logger` instance.
  context.logger.info('Hello $name!');

  // Update vars.
  context.vars['current_year'] = DateTime.now().year;
}
```

**`post_gen.dart`**

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:mason/mason.dart';

Future<void> run(HookContext context) async {
  final progress = context.logger.progress('Installing packages');

  // Run `flutter packages get` after generation.
  await Process.run('flutter', ['packages', 'get']);

  progress.complete();
}
```

:::note
The working directory of the hook is the directory in which the code is generated.
:::

### Disabling Hooks ‚ùå

Hook execution can be disabled using the `--no-hooks` flag:

```bash
# Disable hook script execution
$ mason make example --name Mason --no-hooks
```
